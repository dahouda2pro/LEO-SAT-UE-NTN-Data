# LEO-SAT-UE-NTN-Data

1. CellType : cell Type

2. Latitude : Latitude of the UE

3. Longitude: Longitude: of the UE

4. Time: Time the UE stays in the cell

5. Azimuth: Azimuth between satellite and UE

6. Elevation: Elevation between satellite and UE

7. Range: Distance between satellite and UE

8. EIRP: The effective isotropic radiated power in the link direction. This value is the product of the transmitter power and the transmitter gain in the link direction with the inclusion of user defined post transmit gains and losses.

9. Free Space Loss: Loss due to propagation through free space.

10. Prop Loss: The total propagation loss computed across all enabled propagation models.

11. Rcvd. Iso. Power: Received isotropic power is the power at the receiver before the pre-receive gains/losses and the receiver antenna gain added (in dBW). It is equal to the EIRP with all the channel losses as well as the bandwidth overlap applied.

12. Carrier Power at Rcvr Input: Carrier Power at Rcvr Input is the power at the receiver after the receiver antenna gain added (in dBW). It is equal to the EIRP with all the channel losses as well as the bandwidth overlap and receiver gain applied.

13. Flux Density: The power from the desired transmitter crossing a unit area normal to the direction of wave propagation.

14. g/T:  G/T = (Receiver Gain)/ (System Temperature at the Receiver). The ratio of the receive antenna gain G to the total system temperature T is the "figure of merit" for the receiver (in dB/K). The figure of merit is independent of the point where it is calculated. However, the gain and system temperature must be specified at the same point. 

15. C/No: The carrier to noise density ratio (C/No) where C is the carrier power and No = kT (Boltzmann's constant x system temperature) is the noise density. It is equivalent to C/N with a normalized Bandwidth (B=1).

16. C/N: The carrier to noise ratio (C/N) where C is the carrier power and N = kTB (Boltzmann's constant x system temperature x bandwidth) is the noise power.

17. Eb/No: The energy per bit to noise ratio (Eb/No) where Eb is the energy per bit and No = kT (Boltzmann's constant * system temperature).

18. Propagation Delay: The amount of time required for a signal to propagate through the physical link medium. This will vary depending on the propagation distance and the type of medium.

19. Propagation Distance: The distance of the physical link medium between a transmitter and a receiver for which a signal will travel.

20. Spectral Flux Density: The dimensions are watts/ (m^2 * Hz). The power is computed across the receiver's bandwidth (as seen by the receiver's RF front end). The bandwidth is the receiver's total bandwidth.
